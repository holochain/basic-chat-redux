# Holochain Basic Chat

A simple chat app designed to get new users up, running and developing on Holochain

# Get started using nix-shell

Nix shell is a way to set up a dev environment that is easy to replicate on different machines. See https://github.com/holochain/holonix for more info.

- Install nix tooling on mac/linux
```
  curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```

- Start a new nix-shell. This uses the local `default.nix` file to set up the correct versions of the holochain binaries and build tools.

```
  nix-shell
```

- You should end up with a `[nix-shell:` prompt in your shell.

## Building from Source

### Holochain DNA

There are some helpers scripts in the root package.json for building, running and testing the holochain code.

```
npm run hc:build
npm run hc:start
```

or use the CLI directly

```
mkdir -p dna
cd dna-src
hc package -o ../dna/basic-chat.dna.json
```

*Be careful!* If you are trying to network with other agents it is best to distribute a single compiled dna file. Any differences in compiler configuration may lead to the DNA hash being different and the nodes will not be able to communicate.

### UI

```
cd ui-src
npm install
npm start
```

## Using with Holoscape

If you want to use [Holoscape](https://github.com/holochain/holonix) (and you definitely should!) you can build a Holoscape ready package by running

```
npm run hc:make-holoscape
```

You can then use the holoscape-bundle in the project root to install.
 **Note: You most likely will need to change the DNA hash in the holoscape-bundle.toml file**
